# OCR-using-Tesseract
In this repo, I have used pytesseract as OCR engine. I have performed all the possible image preprocessing steps like image binarization, image denoising, image rescaling etc. It's accuracy also depends on image quality. But for most of the images which are Black and White, like reciept, bill etc, it will give almost accurate answer.
